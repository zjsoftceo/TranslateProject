Wow! Rust-based Redox OS Gets an Anonymous Donation of $390,000 in Cryptocurrency
======
Redox OS just got a massive anonymous donation. What will it be used for? Something exciting!

![Wow! Rust-based Redox OS Gets an Anonymous Donation of $390,000 in Cryptocurrency][1]

[Redox OS][2] is a Unix-like operating system written in Rust.

The project was launched in 2015 by Jeremy Soller, popularly recognized as the Principal Engineer at [System76][3] and a maintainer for [Pop!_OS][4].

We also covered its last release earlier this year:

[Rust-based Redox OS 0.7.0 Arrives with Enhanced Hardware Support][5]

While the update involved improvements that allowed it to boot on more hardware, it may not be a replacement daily driver for most users.

Nevertheless, it is an exciting project to keep an eye on.

**And things got more exciting for it after it received an anonymous donation**.

🤯 Someone just sent **299 Ethereum** to Redux OS's donation address, equivalent to nearly **$3,90,000** (with ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market).

Well, that is a lot of money!

As per Jeremy's last tweet, he hasn't decided immediately what to do with it.

> An anonymous donor just sent 299 Ether (equivalent to 393,000 USD) to the [@redox_os][8] donation address. Both this address and transaction are public. I have no idea what to do with a donation of this size but will have more details soon after some research.[https://t.co/f3yBDghWSh][9]

However, the replies to the tweet give us some good suggestions.

Some suggest donating it to the folks responsible for Rust language, and some suggest using the money to sponsor learning rust and OS development.

He can surely use it to scale up Redox OS or anything else that needs that resource.

At the end of the day, for people who want more Rust-based stuff, this could be indirectly a good thing with whatever Jeremy chooses to do.

Or, maybe buy a Buggati with a Redox OS logo on it? Well, some Twitter users have had hilarious replies to this incident! 😂

>  This is not the first time an open-source project received a significant cryptocurrency donation. The Apache Software Foundation [received bitcoins][13] valued at $1 M in 2018.

I shall update this article when Jeremy decides to share more details on the donation and what he plans to do with it.
